1.
A. variables are local, and are not initialyzed, so compilation fails

2.
B. Main method is not static, so will throw an error when run.

3.
B. variable names may have only one word, and only $ and _ are allowed. Numbers are allowed but not at the beggining.

4.
ACG, for the same reason as 3.

5.
A,D. B will not compile because A compiles and the variables have the same name. C includes int, which makes not compile. E has a semicolon, and the latter part does not compile.

6.
C, E. Chaining asignation operators is allowed. These operators have the less precedence, and are evaluated from right-to-left.

7.
B. The main method is not public, so does not execute.

8.
B. the operations are run left to right, so the final result is 0.

9.
E. The first operation sets 9 to a. Later, the operation trasnlates to 8-7, which is 1.
